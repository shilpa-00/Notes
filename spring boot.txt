Spring framework:
-----------------
	an application framework that provides infrastructure support to develop java based 
applications.

Spring Boot:
----------- 
	creates production ready spring based applications without requiring to write same 
configuration again and again.

Features:
--------
->Spring boot starters
->Spring Boot autoconfiguration
->Externalized configuration
->Spring Boot actuator
->Easy-to-use embedded servlet container support

Different ways to create spring boot project:
---------------------------------------------
1. Using spring initializr-(start.spring.io)
2. Using spring starter project in STS(Eclipse)-(Spring Tool Suite IDE)
3.Spring Boot CLI(command line tool)-(download CLI and create)

Spring Boot auto configuration:
------------------------------
	automatically configures the spring application based on the jar dependencies added.

Why auto configuration:
-----------------------
->Spring based applications have a lot of configurations.
->So, automation of these configurations tasks is provided by spring boot.
->Spring boot automatically configures based on the dependencies added in the class path.

@SpringBootApplication:
----------------------
this annotation contains internally three annotations

->@SpringBootConfiguration internally uses @Configuration
	@SpringBootConfiguration works as @Configuration. @Configuration is used to provide 
configuration as java based configuration. We can do three types of configuration-
	1. XML based configuration
	2. Java based configuration(create a java class and annotate it with @Configuration)
	3. Annotaion based configuration

->@EnableAutoConfiguration
	enables auto configuration classes for our spring boot application.

->@ComponentScan
	to scan spring components in particular package and its sub packages.
